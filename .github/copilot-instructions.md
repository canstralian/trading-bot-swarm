# Using GitHub Copilot with the Trading-Bot-Swarm Project

Welcome to the `trading-bot-swarm` repository! This document provides instructions and best practices for using GitHub Copilot to contribute to this project. Following these guidelines will help streamline your development process, improve code quality, and ensure effective collaboration.

## Overview

The **Trading-Bot-Swarm** project aims to develop a decentralized network of autonomous trading bots that can share intelligence and adapt their strategies collectively. The core is built in Python and leverages various data science, machine learning, and exchange connectivity libraries.

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered pair programmer that can significantly accelerate development by suggesting code, completing functions, and even generating entire modules. Within this project, Copilot can assist with:
* **Developing Trading Strategies:** Scaffolding new strategy classes and technical indicators.
* **Writing Data Connectors:** Generating boilerplate code for connecting to new exchange APIs.
* **Building Backtesting Logic:** Creating functions for performance analysis and simulation.
* **Improving Code Quality:** Adding documentation, type hints, and unit tests.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with Copilot in this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install the Extension:** Make sure you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed in your IDE (e.g., VS Code, JetBrains). You can typically find it in your editor's extension marketplace.
    

2.  **Authenticate Your Account:** After installation, you'll be prompted to sign in to your GitHub account to authorize Copilot. Ensure the account has an active Copilot subscription.

3.  **Enable for the Project:** Copilot should be enabled by default. You can confirm its status by looking for the Copilot icon in your IDE's status bar. Clicking it allows you to enable or disable suggestions globally or for specific languages.

4.  **Provide Project Context:** For the best suggestions, open the project's root folder in your IDE. Copilot works best when it has context from the entire repository, especially from core modules like `/core`, `/strategies`, and `/connectors`.

## Usage Guidelines

To maximize Copilot's effectiveness, use clear comments and descriptive function names. Here are some common use cases specific to this project.

### Generating Trading Strategies

When creating a new strategy in the `/strategies` directory, start with a detailed comment or a class definition.

**Example:**
```python
# In /strategies/rsi_momentum_strategy.py

# A trading strategy class that inherits from the BaseStrategy.
# It should implement the following logic:
# 1. Calculate the 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI).
# 2. Generate a 'buy' signal when RSI crosses below 30.
# 3. Generate a 'sell' signal when RSI crosses above 70.
# 4. Use the `ccxt` library for data fetching.

import pandas as pd
from strategies.base_strategy import BaseStrategy

class RsiMomentumStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    # Let Copilot complete the rest...
