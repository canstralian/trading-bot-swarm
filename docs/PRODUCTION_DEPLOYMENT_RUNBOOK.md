# Production Deployment Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides a comprehensive guide for deploying the Trading Bot Swarm system to production. The system consists of a multi-bot MCP orchestrator with Flask-based APIs, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database.

## Pre-Release Preparations

### Code Review and Security Audit
- Conduct thorough code reviews for all changes.
- Perform security audits focusing on:
  - Input validation in Flask endpoints.
  - API authentication and authorization.
  - Database query sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
  - Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, trading credentials).

### Dependency Updates
- Update all Python dependencies to latest secure versions using `pip-audit`.
- Run `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities, then apply controlled, pinned dependency updates. Prefer manual updates with CI validation, or use automated scanners (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) with review gates. Avoid using `npm audit fix` directly, as it can introduce breaking upgrades; if necessary, use `npm audit fix --only=prod` for production dependencies only.
- Ensure PostgreSQL version is up-to-date and compatible.

### Configuration Management
- Prepare environment-specific configuration files:
  - Production database connection strings.
  - Secure API keys and secrets (use environment variables or secret managers).
  - Logging configurations.
- Validate configurations against security best practices.

### Backup and Data Migration
- Create database backups before deployment.
- **Verify backup restorability:** Perform a backup restore test by restoring the latest backup in the staging environment before deployment. Periodically conduct restore drills to ensure backup integrity.
- Plan for data migrations if schema changes are involved.
- Test migration scripts in staging environment.

## Testing

### Unit and Integration Tests
- Run full test suite: `pytest` for Python backend, `npm test` for React frontend.
- Ensure all tests pass, including API integration tests.
- Validate database operations under load.

### Security Testing
- Perform vulnerability scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP.
- Test for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) in Flask routes.
- Review API rate limiting and CORS configurations.

### Performance Testing
- Conduct load testing simulating trading bot operations.
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network).
- Ensure PostgreSQL queries are optimized and indexed.

### Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment mirroring production.
- Run end-to-end tests including bot orchestration scenarios.
- Validate data consistency and API responses.

## Deployment Steps

### Infrastructure Preparation
- Provision or update cloud resources (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS PostgreSQL).
- Configure load balancers and auto-scaling groups.
- Set up monitoring and logging services (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK stack).

### Application Deployment
1. Build Docker images for Flask app and React frontend.
2. Push images to secure container registry.
3. Update deployment manifests (e.g., Kubernetes YAML or Docker Compose).
4. Deploy to production environment using CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) with a safe rollout strategy:
   - **Choose a rollout strategy:** Use canary, blue/green, or rolling deployment to minimize blast radius.
   - **Canary deployment example:** Route a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 5â€“10%) to the new version initially.
   - **Automated smoke tests:** Run automated smoke tests against the canary/blue environment to validate core functionality (API health, trading bot orchestration, database connectivity).
   - **Approval gates:** Require manual approval from the team before promoting the deployment to 100% traffic.
   - **Monitor:** Continuously monitor application metrics and error rates during rollout. Roll back if issues are detected.

### Database Deployment
- Apply schema migrations safely:
  - Run migrations inside transactions where supported to ensure atomicity and easy rollback.
  - Use the expand-and-contract pattern for backward-compatible, zero-downtime schema changes (e.g., add new columns/tables, migrate data, then remove old columns).
  - Ensure migration scripts are idempotent so they can be safely re-run.
  - Perform a dry-run of migrations in staging to validate changes and catch errors.
  - Document and prepare a clear rollback procedure in case migrations fail (e.g., restore from backup, revert schema changes).
- Update connection strings in application configs.
- Verify database connectivity from application servers.

### Post-Deployment Validation
- Confirm application startup logs.
- Check health endpoints.
- Validate frontend accessibility.

## Health Checks

### Automated Health Checks
- Implement a minimal `/health` endpoint in the Flask app that returns basic liveness status (e.g., "OK") with no sensitive details.
- Move dependency checks (e.g., database connectivity, bot orchestration processes) to a `/ready` endpoint, which should be restricted to internal networks or require authentication.
- Avoid returning detailed error messages or configuration values in health responses.

### Manual Verification
- Access application dashboard.
- Verify trading bot statuses.
- Check log files for errors.

## Monitoring

### Application Monitoring
- Set up application performance monitoring (APM) with tools like New Relic or DataDog.
- Monitor API response times, error rates, and throughput.
- Track custom metrics for bot performance (e.g., trades executed, profit/loss).

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk).
- Set up alerts for high usage or failures.
- Track network latency and availability.

### Logging
- Centralize logs using ELK stack or CloudWatch.
- Implement structured logging in Flask app.
- Set up log rotation and retention policies.

### Security Monitoring
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., unusual API calls).
- Regularly review access logs.

## Rollback

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain previous deployment artifacts (Docker images, configs).
- Document rollback steps for each component.

### Execution
1. Stop current deployment.
2. Roll back to previous stable version.
3. Restore database if necessary (from backups).
4. Restart services and validate health.

### Communication
- Notify stakeholders of rollback.
- Document incident and lessons learned.

## Continuous Improvement

### Post-Mortem Reviews
- Conduct post-deployment reviews.
- Identify areas for improvement in processes or code.

### Automation Enhancements
- Implement more automated testing and deployment steps.
- Refine CI/CD pipelines for faster, safer deployments.

### Security Updates
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches.
- Incorporate security best practices into development workflow.

### Performance Optimization
- Analyze monitoring data to identify bottlenecks.
- Optimize code and infrastructure based on insights.
