```

---

## Health Checks

### 4.1 Application Health

#### Basic Health Check
```bash
# Check application endpoint
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2025-10-15T17:37:53Z"}
```

#### Detailed Health Check
```bash
# Check component health
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health/detailed

# Verify:
# - Database connection: OK
# - Cache connection: OK
# - Message queue: OK
# - External APIs: OK
```

### 4.2 Infrastructure Health

- [ ] CPU utilization < 70%
- [ ] Memory utilization < 80%
- [ ] Disk usage < 85%
- [ ] Network latency < 100ms
- [ ] Database response time < 50ms

### 4.3 Trading System Health

- [ ] Bot coordination working
- [ ] Order execution functioning
- [ ] Portfolio sync operational
- [ ] Risk management active
- [ ] Market data feeds connected

### 4.4 Monitoring Dashboards

Access the following dashboards to verify system health:

- **Application Dashboard**: Monitor application metrics, request rates, error rates
- **Infrastructure Dashboard**: Monitor server resources, network, storage
- **Trading Dashboard**: Monitor trading activity, positions, PnL
- **Security Dashboard**: Monitor authentication, authorization, suspicious activity

---

## Monitoring

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Application Metrics
- Request rate (requests/second)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (%)
- Active connections
- Queue depth

#### Trading Metrics
- Order success rate
- Order latency
- Slippage
- Position count
- Profit/Loss (PnL)

#### Infrastructure Metrics
- CPU utilization (%)
- Memory usage (GB)
- Disk I/O (IOPS)
- Network throughput (Mbps)
- Database connections

### 5.2 Alert Thresholds

#### Critical Alerts (Page immediately)
- Application down (no response to health checks)
- Database connection failure
- Security breach detected
- Trading losses exceed threshold
- Exchange API connectivity lost

grep ERROR /var/log/trading-bot-swarm/app.log

# For containerized deployments
docker logs -f trading-bot-swarm
# or
kubectl logs -f deployment/trading-bot-swarm
```

#### Key Log Patterns to Monitor

## Rollback Procedures

### 6.1 When to Rollback

Initiate rollback if:
- Critical functionality is broken
- Data corruption is detected
- Security vulnerability is exploited
- System performance degrades significantly
- Trading losses exceed acceptable threshold
- More than 5% error rate persists for > 5 minutes

### 6.2 Rollback Process

#### Step 1: Immediate Actions
```bash
# Stop all trading activity
./scripts/emergency-stop.sh

# Enable maintenance mode
./scripts/enable-maintenance.sh

# Notify stakeholders
./scripts/notify-incident.sh "ROLLBACK_INITIATED"
```

#### Step 2: Rollback Application
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git checkout tags/v<previous-version>

# Rollback containerized deployment
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.previous.yml up -d

# or for Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/trading-bot-swarm
kubectl rollout status deployment/trading-bot-swarm
```

#### Step 3: Rollback Database
```bash
# Only if database changes are incompatible
./scripts/rollback-db.sh

# Restore from backup if needed
./scripts/restore-db.sh <backup-timestamp>
```

#### Step 4: Verification
```bash
# Run health checks
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Verify critical functionality
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh

# Check logs for errors
./scripts/check-logs.sh
```

#### Step 5: Resume Operations
```bash
# Disable maintenance mode
./scripts/disable-maintenance.sh

# Re-enable trading gradually
./scripts/enable-trading.sh --gradual

# Monitor closely for 30 minutes
```

### 6.3 Post-Rollback Actions

- [ ] Document rollback reason and timeline
- [ ] Conduct incident retrospective
- [ ] Update rollback procedures based on learnings
- [ ] Create bug tickets for issues found
- [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders

### 6.4 Rollback Testing

- [ ] Test rollback procedure quarterly in staging
- [ ] Document rollback time (target: < 15 minutes)
- [ ] Verify data consistency after rollback
- [ ] Update runbook based on test results
