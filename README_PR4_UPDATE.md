## Why This Update Is Needed

PR #4 has completed all its tasks (checklist is 100% complete), but the title still shows `[WIP]` (Work In Progress). This update removes that confusion and provides a clearer description of what was accomplished, making it easier for reviewers to understand and approve the PR.
