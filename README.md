# Trading Bot Swarm

A sophisticated, multi-bot platform for orchestrating automated trading strategies across various cryptocurrency exchanges. This system is designed for scalability, allowing a "swarm" of bots to operate independently while being managed and monitored from a central point.

## Features

*   **Multi-Bot Architecture:** Run multiple trading bots simultaneously, each with its own strategy and configuration.
*   **Strategy Engine:** Supports a variety of trading strategies, including:
    *   Trend Following
    *   Mean Reversion
    *   Momentum
    *   (and easily extensible for more)
*   **Centralized Orchestration:** A core engine to manage, monitor, and control the entire swarm of bots.
*   **Market Data Analysis:** Integrates with various data sources and technical analysis libraries to inform trading decisions.
*   **Portfolio Management:** Tracks capital, positions, and performance across all bots.
*   **Risk Management:** Implements risk controls such as stop-loss and take-profit orders.
*   **Extensible and Modular:** The project is structured to be easily extended with new bots, strategies, and exchange integrations.
*   **Ready for Monitoring:** Includes support for Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring bot performance and system health.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.12 or higher
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd trading-bot-swarm
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the configuration:**
    *   Copy the environment template: `cp config/.env.template config/.env`
    *   Edit `config/.env` to add your API keys and other secrets.
    *   Review and customize `config/config.yaml` for your trading strategies and bot configurations.

## Usage

To run the main application, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure to configure your bots and strategies in the `config/config.yaml` file before running the application.

## Testing

To run the test suite, use `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
